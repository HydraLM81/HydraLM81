### Hello World

I'm Hydra, a high-school student based in California who enjoys coding, planes, and crying every night (the coding part doesn't work right too often).

The coding languages I actually know are C++ and Python, but I also know parts of others.

Currently learning:
- How to fly (legally)
- How to weld
- How to drive (a forklift (legally))

Currently working on:
- An interactive IDE for Python, written in Python with PyGame. *Totally* a great idea.
